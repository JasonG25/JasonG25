# 👋 Hi, I'm Jason!
I'm a high school student passionate about computer science, engineering, and software development. 

I'm currently an **IB student** and a programmer on my school's **FRC robotics team 8015**. 

## 🚀 Skills
- Languages: Java, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: WPILib (FRC), Android (Java), simple web dev
- Tools: Git, Android Studio, Visual Studio Code
- Interests: CPU overclocking, machine learning, robotics

I’ve studied core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees) and basic algorithms, and I’m familiar with OOP principles like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, as well as using abstract classes and templates. In machine learning, I’ve worked with models like linear regression, decision trees, and KNN, and used tools like Pandas for data cleaning and evaluation methods such as cross-validation and confusion matrices. 

## 🌟 Projects
- 🤖 **FRC Robot Code**: Command-based structure for subsystems and commands
- 📱 **Scouting App**: Built for FRC team using Android Studio
- 🚦 **Flexible Traffic Light Report**: A independent research in Fudan University CS workstation
- 🌐 **Shanghai Opera Website**: Developing a website developed for Shanghai Opera sharing

## 📚 Activities
- **Participate in the FRC club 8015 for 2 years** (technician, scouting lead, and programming lead, respectively, in Sacramento 2024, Beijing 2024, Port Hueneme 2025)
  - Participate in the **command based code for the robot**.
  - Managed the **git repository** of the code base. 
  - Led the **building and wiring** for several subsystems.
  - **Taught new members** about programming, building, and wiring knowledge. 
  - Participated in **MakerFaire and club fairs** with the team regularly. 
  - **Helped teams outside the school** to develop their team by providing technical support. 
- Established **Science Assembly** at grade 9 and keep participating (publishing articles and holding science fairs)
  - (Here’s the link of the article sent when I established the club: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ApnQVd2sGxbnUC_A9j9dWw)
- Established **Computing & Linguistic club** at grade 11 (teaching CS knowledge & programming as a interdisciplinary tool).
- Attend the **machine learning club** at school
  - Participating the data analysis competition HiMCM
  - Participating basic competitions on Kaggle.
- Attend the **Fudan University CS workstation** and chosen as the **recommended candidate**. 

- **Others**:
  - Practicing and performing **Shanghai Opera**
     - Played a leading role in the first all-teen production in the opera history, featured in Xinmin Evening News.
     - Got the Xiaobai Yulan Award (Top 1% ~ 5%) Nominee for Shanghai Opera. 
  - Practice **fencing** and play **clarinet** as hobbies during spare time.  

## 🛠️ Learning in Progress
- Exploring advanced methods like **state machines and pure pursuit control** for FRC robot code
- Trying to **build a game with Unity** in C++
- **IB EE Project**: Writing about CPU overclocking and energy efficiency across tasks
